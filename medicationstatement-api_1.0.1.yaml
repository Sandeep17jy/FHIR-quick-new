  MedicationStatement:
    description: >-
      A record of a medication that is being consumed by a patient.   A
      MedicationStatement may indicate that the patient may be taking the
      medication now or has taken the medication in the past or will be taking
      the medication in the future.  The source of this information can be the
      patient, significant other (such as a family member or spouse), or a
      clinician.  A common scenario where this information is captured is during
      the history taking process during a patient visit or stay.   The
      medication information may come from sources such as the patient's memory,
      from a prescription bottle,  or from a list of medications the patient,
      clinician or other party maintains. 


      The primary difference between a medication statement and a medication
      administration is that the medication administration has complete
      administration information and is based on actual administration
      information from the person who administered the medication.  A medication
      statement is often, if not always, less specific.  There is no required
      date/time when the medication was administered, in fact we only know that
      a source has reported the patient is taking this medication, where details
      such as time, quantity, or rate or even medication product may be
      incomplete or missing or less precise.  As stated earlier, the medication
      statement information may come from the patient's memory, from a
      prescription bottle or from a list of medications the patient, clinician
      or other party maintains.  Medication administration is more formal and is
      not missing detailed information.
